# MarkerBA
You can run this demo code to learning how can we use a planar marker in bundle adjustment with planar and rectangle constraint.

## You can find the math detail in note file
In order to save the plannar constraint, The Marker is paramter with a Lie se3 instead of using conner coordinates.
